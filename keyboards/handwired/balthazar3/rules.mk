PS2_MOUSE_ENABLE = no 		# use ps/2 touchpad - not yet
MOUSEKEY_ENABLE = no        	# Mouse keys - we dont use buttons on mousepad, but on keyboard
#To use USART on the ATMega32u4, you have to use PD5 for clock and PD2 for data.
#If one of those are unavailable, you need to use interrupt version.
#PS2_USE_INT = yes  		# first we us this one
#PS2_USE_USART = yes		# later we will use this one

#CUSTOM_MATRIX 		# Allows replacing the standard matrix scanning routine with a custom one.
#DEBOUNCE_TYPE			# Allows replacing the standard key debouncing routine with an alternative or custom one.
#WAIT_FOR_USB  = yes		#Forces the keyboard to wait for a USB connection to be established before it starts up
#NO_USB_STARTUP_CHECK  = yes	#Disables usb suspend check after keyboard startup. Usually the keyboard waits for the host to wake it up before any tasks are performed. This is useful for split keyboards as one half will not get a wakeup call but must send commands to the master.
